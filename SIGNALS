== Signal handling

In general, signals need only be sent to the master process.  However,
the signals unicorn uses internally to communicate with the worker
processes are documented here as well.

=== Master Process

 * HUP - reload config file and gracefully restart all workers

 * INT/TERM - quick shutdown, kills all workers immediately

 * QUIT - graceful shutdown, waits for workers to finish their
   current request before finishing.

 * USR1 - reopen all logs owned by the master and all workers
   See Unicorn::Util.reopen_logs for what is considered a log.

 * USR2 - reexecute the running binary.  A separate QUIT
   should be sent to the original process once the child is verified to
   be up and running.

=== Worker Processes

Sending signals directly to the worker processes should not normally be
needed.  If the master process is running, any exited worker will be
automatically respawned.

 * INT/TERM - quick shutdown, immediately exit

 * QUIT - gracefully exit after finishing the current request

 * USR1 - reopen all logs owned by the worker process
   See Unicorn::Util.reopen_logs for what is considered a log.
