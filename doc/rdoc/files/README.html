      <h2><a href="../classes/Mongrel.html">Mongrel</a>: Simple Fast Mostly Ruby Web Server</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Mongrel.html">Mongrel</a> is a small library that
provides a very fast HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby web applications. It is not
particular to any framework, and is intended to be just enough to get a web
application running behind a more complete and robust web server.
</p>
<p>
What makes <a href="../classes/Mongrel.html">Mongrel</a> so fast is the
careful use of a C extension to provide fast HTTP 1.1 protocol parsing and
fast URI lookup. This combination makes the server very fast without too
many portability issues.
</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Mongrel.html">Mongrel</a> is still very ALPHA work, but
you can see how it&#8217;s used with the Camping framework (version 1.2)
and take a look at how you might use it. Right now it handles HTTP requests
well and process the responses fast, but you have to &quot;roll your
own&quot; response code.
</p>
<p>
The next release of <a href="../classes/Mongrel.html">Mongrel</a> will have
improved IO handling, much more stability, and should have a better <a
href="../classes/Mongrel/HttpResponse.html">Mongrel::HttpResponse</a>
object with more useful features.
</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>
You can install it via source from <a
href="http://www.zedshaw.com/downloads/mongrel">www.zedshaw.com/downloads/mongrel</a>/
or you can gram a RubyGem at <a
href="http://www.zedshaw.com/downloads/mongrel">www.zedshaw.com/downloads/mongrel</a>/
and install that manually. I&#8217;m working on setting up a RubyForge
project.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#8217;t explicitly require Camping, but if you want to run the
examples/tepee.rb example then you&#8217;ll need to install Camping 1.2 at
least (and redcloth I think). These are all available from RubyGems.
</p>
<p>
The library consists of a C extension so you&#8217;ll need a C compiler or
at least a friend who can build it for you.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the source include a setup.rb for those who hate RubyGems.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Best place to look for usage examples right now is the examples/ directory.
</p>
<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>
This 0.1.2 release will not be as fast as the 0.1.1 release since
I&#8217;ve temporarily removed threads as a test. There were many stability
issues related to handling each request in a thread, especially on OSX.
I&#8217;ve taken them out for now to make things stable. Even with this
removed <a href="../classes/Mongrel.html">Mongrel</a> is still pretty fast
compared to WEBrick.
</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>
E-mail zedshaw at zedshaw.com and I&#8217;ll help. Comments about the API
are welcome.
