h1. Mongrel Licensing

Mongrel is licensed under the "LGPL":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html and is copyright Zed A. Shaw
as of 2005.  If you use Mongrel and are worried about the 
licensing status, then you should talk with your legal team
and follow their advice.  If you use Mongrel and
are concerned about how that impacts your software, then contact 
me about a commercial license or how you can donate to a charity to get a commercial license.

I don't use "LGPL":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html to force people to also "LGPL":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html license their software,
but rather to make sure that people who modify *Mongrel* give back to
the community.  The general rule is that if you treat the 
Mongrel RubyGem directory like it's a got an evil firewall
around it then you're good.  You can link to it, run your
applications under it, and even write GemPlugins to change
Mongrel without touching the source.

If you dip into the Mongrel RubyGem directory and change
even one line of source, or copy a portion of the source
into your project, then you have to do the following:

* E-mail me what you changed and find out if I would include it in Mongrel.  Usually I will.
* If I can't or won't include it, then consider taking it out and writing a GemPlugin.
* If you have to have this change in Mongrel and I can't take the patch (since it's specific to your application),
  *and* you can't make a GemPlugin, then you'll have to either:
** License your software under the "LGPL":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html and release it.
** Include the changed files in your release and allow the customer to access them, giving proper attribution.
** Contact me for a commercial license.
** Contact me about donating to a charity in exchange for a commercial license.

I'm not interested in hunting people down who use Mongrel in
commercial products nor am I a GPL zealot.  I understand that 
folks just want to run their software under Mongrel and might
need to make a few changes.  As long as you share those changes
when you make them then I'll be happy and you'll be safe.


h2. Non-profit Organizations

If you're a registered non-profit organization that is using 
Mongrel then you don't have to worry about any of the above.
You are free to use Mongrel however you want and I'll even
be willing to help you out in exchange for tax credit or 
just to be a good guy.

I'd appreciate your changes or stories about how you're using
it, but otherwise feel free to use Mongrel however you want.


h2. GemPlugins

The GemPlugins system is both freely available *and* 
licensed under the Ruby License.  Feel free to use it just
like you would Ruby and work it into your projects as you
need.  This is done so people can write their own GemPlugins
for Mongrel without having to re-license them under the
"LGPL":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html.


h2. Some Charities To Consider

Any charity that helps children is a good one.  My personal
favorite is "The Train Platform Schools":http://www.globalfundforchildren.org/project_profiles/train_schools.htm
in India.  They help children who are extremely poor get food,
medical attention, and education by holding small school sessions
on the train platforms in Bhubaneswar, India.
