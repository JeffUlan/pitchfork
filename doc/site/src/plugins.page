h1. Available Mongrel Plugins

Mongrel is designed to be *very* easy to extend with the
"GemPlugin":/gem_plugin_rdoc/index.html system.  With
GemPlugin anyone can extend Mongrel's commands or handlers
then distribute them as regular RubyGems for people to install.

* mongrel_cluster -- Very sweet plugin that lets you manage a
  pack of Mongrels easily as well as dealing with Capistrano issues.


h2. Licensing

People interested in extending Mongrel and avoiding licensing
problems (Mongrel is LGPL) can use GemPlugins without any
problems since the GemPlugin system is Ruby Licensed.
