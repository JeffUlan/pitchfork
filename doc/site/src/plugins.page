h1. Available Mongrel Plugins

Mongrel is designed to be *very* easy to extend with the
"GemPlugin":/gem_plugin_rdoc/index.html system.  With
GemPlugin anyone can extend Mongrel's commands or handlers
then distribute them as regular RubyGems for people to install.

To install a plugin you typically install it like you do any other
gem by running @gem install GEMNAME@ and replace GEMNAME with the
name below.  All gems are managed by their authors, but most authors
hang out in the "mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=1306 
and will answer your questions. 

* mongrel_cluster -- Very sweet plugin that lets you manage a
  pack of Mongrels easily as well as dealing with Capistrano issues.

h2. Getting Your Plugin Listed

Just shoot a message to the "mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=1306
and you'll get hooked up.


h2. Licensing

Mongrel and GemPlugin are both "licensed the same as Ruby":/license.page so
you can use it the same as Ruby.
