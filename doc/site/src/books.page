h1. Books About or Mentioning Mongrel

This is a list of *all* the books available for Mongrel not just the one
written by Matt Pelletier and myself (Zed).  The more books that are out there
in as many languages the better off everyone is so I'm listing other competitors.

h2. Mongrel: Serving, Deploying, and Extending Your Ruby Applications

This is of course the more or less official book, but don't take that to mean
the others are bad.  It focuses entirely on Mongrel and is written by the
Mongrel author (me, Zed) and Matt Pelletier.

"You can buy it online as a PDF.":http://www.awprofessional.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0321483502&rl=1

h2. Repensando a web com Rails

This book was written by Fabio Akita with contributions from myself (Zed) and Piers Harding.  It is a book in Brazilian Portuguese and seems to cover quite a bit of material.

h1. Not Mentioned?

If you're book hasn't been published yet then wait until it's available in at least beta form then shoot me an e-mail so I can include it.  Include purchase links and any website links.
