h1. Get Mongrel Certified!

I'm not one to be overpowered by the great ideas of other open source projects.
But, the second I smell cash to be had from hapless tools using my software I am THERE!  Once I 
read "the CakePHP Certification plans":http://www.cakefoundation.org/pages/certification
I thought, "Holy crap, I could make more money than Don King's ring finger doing that!"

After much deliberation with absolutely nobody, I am proud to announce the 
official *Mongrel Ultimate Deployment Certified Rails Aptitude Program(tm)(sm)(patent pending)*.

The only certification you need to get that cushy job making developers beg you
for system administration services while you surf porn instead of doing your 
real job.  Nothing says "professionalism" more than having MUDCRAP-CE after your
name.

Start now and even you could append up to *nine* (yes nine!) letters
after your name and get a guaranteed pay raise or that great job without know *anything*
other than how to tell other people how to pronounce your particular certification acronym.

Prices are also very high, since your manager knows that the cost of a certification
program directly relates to its quality.  The more you spend the more you show management
that you're a team player.  No, a MUDCRAP Team Player!


h2. How To Get That Cert!

MUDCRAP certification involves intensive training courses from me (Zed A. Shaw) the creator of Mongrel.
I am only available at specific conferences and will only teach a select chosen few
MUDCRAPers per conference.  Each set of courses trains the prospective MUDCRAPer in:

* Defending your job with claims of "security", "scalability", and "capability" 
just like the Enterprise guys.
* Inventing performance numbers for fun and profit.  Nothing lies better than complex well crafted
statistics.  Learn to use them to compete with other people's fake statistics.
* Using the new OSX virtual desktop features to hide your chosen fetish porn while you work.
* Inventing your very own security policies to do even less work.  Management has entrusted
you with managing the systems, and that means you get to set the policies everyone follows.  Use
this power to make your life easier.
* Avoiding automating your system administration job so that you always have something to pretend 
working on.
* Blaming *developers* for your mistakes.  *EXTRA* This course now covers
using complex permissioning systems and shared directories to "protect" your servers from 
the developers while actually only protecting your job.
* Unlearning everything you probably didn't know about Configuration Management and collaboration.
Nobody needs you to cooperate when you're the *king of the kingdom*.

And this is just a few of the great lessons awaiting you in these wonderful classes.

h2. Ordering Information

E-mail zedshaw at zedshaw.com to reserve a seat.  The next class is at RubyConf and will
only seat 10 people.  That's how dedicated I am to the quality of my courses.  You
will leave my course feeling confident, empowered, and capable enough to avoid learning anything
ever again for at least 10 years.

Act now to become the first MUDCRAPer!  Seats are filling fast!
