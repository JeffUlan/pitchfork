h1. Commercial Sponsorship

Mongrel is a free open source web server and will always remain that way, but
that doesn't mean that companies don't help to make it better.

Mongrel now has sponsorship from "EastMedia":http://www.eastmedia.com
in partnership with "VeriSign":http://www.verisign.com/ to make Mongrel 
fast and stable enough for enterprise class loads (meaning "gigantic", 
not "Java style").  Their sponsorship has made it possible to get large 
pools of test servers, payment to myself for work done, and a real 
application to use Mongrel on.  Everyone should toss out a thanks 
to them since this may mean I'll get to work on Mongrel full time 
in the near future and it will raise the quality of Ruby application 
hosting in general.  Not to mention the fact that they are letting all 
of my Mongrel work stay LGPL licensed and open source.  

Other companies benefiting from Ruby should take this as an example.  I 
can think of quite a few things (Ruby 1.9 and a real virtual machine are 
just two) that need some serious commercial cash to get them in gear.  If 
you're making cash off Ruby consider hiring a developer part-time, 
full-time, or posting a bounty for something you need as well as the 
community needs.  There's no better time for enlightened self-interest than now.

The kind folks at "railsmachine.net":http://railsmachine.com/ have also donated 
three VPS accounts for testing various installations on their hosting service.  
They plan to use Mongrel as the default hosting setup in the very near future.


h1. The People Who Made It Possible

make Mongrel.  If I missed anyone then just e-mail me and I'll put your
