h1. The People Who Made It Possible

There's quite a few people who either directly or indirectly helped to
make Mongrel.  If I missed anyone then just e-mail me and I'll put your
name here.

h2. Site Template

The site's look and template is blatantly stolen from "OWD":http://openwebdesign.org
and is specifically Copyright &copy; 2006 "Evgeni Dinev":http://www.evgenidinev.com/

h2. Photos

The photos were found on "Flickr":http://flickr.com and are all licensed under the
"Creative Commons":http://creativecommons.org license.  The following images are
attributed to the people based on their Flickr accounts:

h2. Coding

* "Rick Olson (aka technoweenie)":http://techno-weenie.net/ was the first to grab Mongrel
  and cram "Camping":http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html into it.
* "Why the lucky stiff":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ did work on getting the "Camping Framework":http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html working with Mongrel more completely.

h2. Tools

* "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/ for providing space and hooking it all up.
* "Webgen":http://webgen.rubyforge.org/

h2. Testing

Lots of people from the 
"Ruby on Rails mailing list":http://lists.rubyonrails.org/mailman/listinfo/rails 
and "ruby-lang mailing list":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/20020104.html found bugs
reported them.
