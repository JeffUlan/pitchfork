h1. Commercial Sponsorship

Mongrel is a free open source web server and will always remain that way, but
that doesn't mean that companies don't help to make it better.

Mongrel received sponsorship from "EastMedia Group":http://www.eastmedia.com
in partnership with "VeriSign":http://www.verisign.com/ to make Mongrel 
fast and stable enough for their "PIP":http://pip.verisignlabs.com/
which should be a great Single Sign-On application and is being released open source.

Other companies benefiting from Ruby should take this as an example.  I 
can think of quite a few things (Ruby 1.9 and a real virtual machine are 
just two) that need some serious commercial cash to get them in gear.  If 
you're making cash off Ruby consider hiring a developer part-time, 
full-time, or posting a bounty for something you need as well as the 
community needs.  There's no better time for enlightened self-interest than now.


h1. The People Who Made It Possible

There's quite a few people who either directly or indirectly helped to
make Mongrel.  If I missed anyone then just e-mail me and I'll put your
name here.

* Mongrel was started by "Zed A. Shaw":http://www.zedshaw.com/
* Win32 support for services was done by Luis Lavena.
* Specialized Win32 gems were setup by Wilson Bilkovich.
* Why the lucky stiff implemented initial Camping support as well as improvements to Mongrel's file processing.
* Dan Kubb contributed conditional HTTP responses.

Also with lots of testing from tons of people who are really appreciated.

  and cram "Camping":http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html into it.
* "Why the lucky stiff":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ did work on getting the "Camping Framework":http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html working with Mongrel more completely.
* Dan Kubb hooked up sweet Conditional HTTP Response support for Mongrel making it pretty damn fast for static files.
* Lots of other folks have sent in patches and tweaks.  Let me know if I missed you.
