h1. What is Mongrel?

Mongrel is a fast HTTP library and server for Ruby that is intended for
hosting Ruby web applications of any kind using plain HTTP rather than
FastCGI or SCGI.  It is framework agnostic and already supports 
Ruby On Rails, Og+Nitro, and Camping frameworks.


h2. Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Mongrel is to install it via RubyGems
and then run a Ruby on Rails application.  You can do this easily:

 $ sudo gem install mongrel
 $ cd myrailsapp
 $ mongrel_rails start -d

Which runs Mongrel in the background.  You can stop it with:

 $ mongrel_rails stop

And you're all set.


h3. Win32 Folks

The only thing you people need to do right now is avoid the -d
option to start.  Win32 doesn't support POSIX fork so it won't
go into the background.  I'll be adding support for making
Mongrel a service in a few releases.


h2. Performance

Mongrel's main competitor is WEBrick and "Tomcat":http://tomcat.apache.org/ but not 
a full webserver like "Apache":http://httpd.apache.org/ or "lighttpd":http://www.lighttpd.net/
for serving static content.  Mongrel is designed to run a web application with minimal
static content capabilities with the idea that you'll put it behind a webserver that's
faster for the static stuff.

So far Mongrel seems competitive with Tomcat and typically blows the doors off WEBrick.
Comparing Mongrel with Tomcat right now is not too fair since Tomcat does a whole lot
more, but for serving basic content mongrel does pretty good.

There will be a more formal performance analysis when Mongrel is more stable.


h2. Documentation

Check out the "RDoc":/rdoc/index.html documentation to get a look at the
API and dig into the source.  Since Mongrel is currently being used by
other frameworks it's documentation is aimed at developers.  Real manuals
will be written when there's something for "regular" folks to use.
