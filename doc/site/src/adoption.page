h1. Adoption of Mongrel

A collection of people who've adopted Mongrel as their deployment
or development server of choice.  If you have a success story, post
it to the "mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/mongrel-users 
telling people about it.  The site doesn't have to be public, just tell
us how Mongrel made your life easier and what you like about it.


h2. Alison Rowland

"After months of tearing my hair out due to a lack of reliable Rails  
deployment solutions, I found Mongrel. Thanks to Mongrel's simplicity  
and stability, my hair is growing back. My Rails apps love Mongrel,  
too, because it never lets them down."

h2. Josh Harvey

We're currently running [our site]:"http://www.rashgash.com" on a Xeon 1300 Blade 
server. I'm not even sure exactly what that is, but the getup has been 
running without a hitch for over a month now. The site is powered by a 
pack of 4 Mongrels (0.3.12.4) with mongrel_cluster 0.1.1 behind Pound 
1.8.2. Lighttpd handles the static stuff.

We're only serving 1,000 pages a day at this point, and I haven't done 
any brutal load testing, so all I can say is that the system was a cinch 
to setup and works beautifully.

h2. "Jason Wong":http://www.jasonwong.org/ ("i5labs":http://www.i5labs.com/)

Jason uses Mongrel and Apache on several sites:

 * "Epson Developers":http://www.epsondevelopers.com/
 * "Helium Report":http://www.heliumreport.com/

h2. Matt Pelletier ("EastMedia Group, Inc.":http://www.eastmedia.com/)

Matt uses Mongrel on nearly everything including the recent 
"VeriSign PIP Project":http://pip.verisignlabs.com/ project.

h2. Ruby On Rails

Dan Peterson and friends managed to convert the whole "RubyOnRails":http://www.rubyonrails.org/
to Apache and Mongrel.

h2.  Josh Goebel

His "Pastie":http://pastie.caboo.se/ uses Mongrel and it's a slick little paste site
with a nice IRC integrated bot.

h2.  "MarkaBoo":http://www.markaboo.com/

MarkaBoo is a social bookmarking site that started as a prototype
and evolved into an open-source business model experiment. We are releasing the
code under Creative Commons license on Rubyforge and are allowing the community
to drive the features as we approach 1.0. Our only revenue stream is from
Adsense (and sadly it will be a while before it covers expenses). MarkaBoo lets
you treat URLs, files, and content you create uniformly. So you could bookmark
a PDF, a website, and a snippet of code and access them all uniformly. We even
let you bookmark via email and mobile phone.

h3. Honorable Mentions

* Fear of Fish says: "Fear of Fish isn't using it yet, but he will do when his current large project goes live."  He likes third person.
* Wilson Bilkovich (Defiler) says: " Can I get on there saying that the web was a hollow lie before Mongrel was released?"  No, that quote is full of lies.

h1. Actually Adopting A Mongrel

If you're thinking of getting dog, consider adopting a real Mongrel
instead.

* Rescue a racing dog from "Greyhound Connection":http://www.greyhoundconnection.com/
* Adopt a homeless buddy from "The Humane Society":http://www.hsus.org/
* I judge people by how they treat beings weaker than themselves, and the "SPCA":http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer are good people.
