h3. Q: How does Mongrel relate to SCGI?

Mongrel and SCGI are *completely unrelated* except for the fact that I wrote 
the SCGI Rails Runner and Mongrel.

There has been some confusion by people as to how Mongrel and SCGI are related.  
Some folks actually think that Mongrel uses SCGI to run Ruby on Rails or other 
web applications.  Their confusion can be summarized in this diagram:

!images/mongrel_not_scgi.jpg!

As you can see on the *right*, Ruby on Rails (and other web apps) 
run *inside* Mongrel as just straight Ruby code and are served
using *regular HTTP*.  There are no:

# Additional network protocols other than HTTP.
# Started processes for each request.
# External connectors or libraries required.
# Additional server software.
# Need for SCGI at all ever no way.

In fact *you could drop lighttpd completely* from both diagrams and just serve
your Mongrel server straight to the network.


h3. Q: How is Mongrel designed?

The design of Mongrel most closely matches "Simple":http://simpleweb.sourceforge.net/ 
which is very nicely designed web server framework for Java.  Despite being written
in Java it is very clean and simple, thus the name (clever eh?).  The main difference
between Mongrel and Simple is that Simple monitors returned output from handlers so that
it can modify the results.  Mongrel instead uses Ruby's blocks to get the same effect.

As for the internals of Mongrel there are a few key technologies being used:

* A custom HTTP 1.1 parser written based on the "RFC":http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html
  standard and using "an ABNF dump":http://www.cs.columbia.edu/sip/syntax/rfc2068.html thankfully
  put online by someone.  The parser is written using "Ragel":http://www.elude.ca/ragel/ and 
  is written C as a Ruby extension.
* A URIClassifier that uses a "Ternary Search Trie":http://www.octavian.org/cs/software.html
  written by Peter A. Friend and modified to quickly look up handlers for a URI based on
  a prefix.  This makes finding any handler from any URI quick and painless and is much
  faster than the alternative of parsing the path and using nested Hash structures.
* A simple server that uses the parser and URIClassifier to process requests, find the 
  right handlers, and then pass the results on to the handler for processing.
* Handlers are responsible for using HttpRequest and HttpResponse objects to do their
  thing and then return results.

Other than this there's not much more to it.

h3. Q: Is it multi-threaded or can it handle concurrent requests?

Mongrel is uses a pool of thread workers to do it's processing.  This means that
it is able to handle concurrent access and should be thread safe.  This also
means that you have to be more careful about how you use Mongrel.  You can't
just write your application assuming that there are no threads involved.

Camping and Og+Nitro are supposed to be thread safe and work with Mongrel directly.
This hasn't been heavily tested so people should let me know if they get weird
explosions under heavy load.

Ruby on Rails is not thread safe so there is a synchronized block around the calls
to Dispatcher.dispatch.  This means that everything is threaded right before and
right after Rails runs.  While Rails is running there is only one controller
in operation at a time.


h2. Web Site

h3. Q: How did you make this site?

The site was actually incredibly easy to create.  I simply went to "OSWD":http://openwebdesign.org/
and found a design that fit what I wanted for the site.  I then went to "Flickr":http://flickr.com/
and found pictures of various animals that were licensed under the 
"Creative Commons":http://creativecommons.org/ license.  Once I chopped the images up, worked them
into the design structure, and wrote an initial set of content I was done.

The tool I use to generate the site is called "webgen":http://webgen.rubyforge.org/ which
is a static site generator written in Ruby.  I write all of the content using redcloth
mark-up and leave the generation to webgen.  Finally I hooked into the Mongrel Rakefile
so that it's auto-generated and deployed to the site for me.

Refer to the "attributions":/attributions.html page for information on the resources used.


h2. Deployment

h3. Q: How do I deploy Mongrel in production?

Take a look at the "HOWTO":docs/howto.html and the "Lighttpd":docs/lighttpd.html
instructions for more information on this.
