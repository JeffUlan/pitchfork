h1. Available Documentation


h2. RDoc API Documentation

Check out the "RDoc":/rdoc/index.html documentation to get a look at the
API and dig into the source.  Since Mongrel is currently being used by
other frameworks it's documentation is aimed at developers.  Real manuals
will be written when there's something for "regular" folks to use.


h2. Frequently Asked Questions

When people ask questions really frequently the results end up in the
"FAQ":faq.html or if they're funny they end up in the "FASQ":fasq.html
so everyone can have a laugh.
