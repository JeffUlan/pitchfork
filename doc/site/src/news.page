h2. Feb-12: Mongrel 0.3.1 Released

This release improves the support for Ruby On Rails, creates a new
Command/Plugin functionality, and fixes a huge nasty bug in how content
was served with Rails.  If you saw weird file serving such as broken
images and other bad downloads then this is the fix for you.

"Download 0.3.1":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1306


h2. Feb-12: New site created.

This is kind of an experiment in seeing what type of site is possible
using just Creative Commons licensed content.  See the "attributions":attributions.html
page for more information.
