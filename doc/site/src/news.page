h2.  Mar-03:  Mongrel 0.3.7.1 -- Solid Rails, Win32, SwitchTower, Docs

A slightly longer time between releases but this is packed with lots of good 
things for people who want to run Mongrel.  We're talking Win32 CPU affinity,
better service, POSIX signal control for SwitchTower, more tested platforms,
little bug fixes, and documentation on deployment best practices.

This release has also been tested on tons of platforms:  Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD,
Windows, and Mac OSX.  Under FreeBSD Mongrel seems to ignore signals unless
you do one more network connection, but the other platforms work great.

* Initial beginning of the plugin support that will let people write 
  their own handlers and other things for Mongrel. 
* Timeout now works again but couldn't find an alternative to the buggy Timeout class. 
* SwitchTower friendly signal handling for mongrel_rails. 
* Win32: New option that lets you set a mongrel service's CPU affinity. 
* Win32: Indicates default environment used for the services. 
* Win32: Avoids touching signals when on windows. 
* A fix for CGI encoding redirects wrong when SERVER_PORT isn't specified.
* Tested on: Linux, Win32, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OSX.

h2.  Feb-22:  Mongrel 0.3.6 -- Win32 Services Galore

Thanks to Luis Lavena we have an almost complete win32 service
runner and management script that lets you setup services in windows for
all the different rails apps you have.  This means you can control the
services from the command line or from the Services console.
"Check the Win32 HOWTO":docs/win32.html for more information on using it.
It still has some problems with stopping, but otherwise it's great.

h2.  Feb-18: Mongrel 0.3.5 -- CGI Actually Works

The CGIWrapper code I had written was complete and utter crap, so 
I rewrote it and now it should be very correct.  After looking at
more CGI code I think I'll set my sights on the CGI::process, CGI::Cookie::process,
and read_multipart functions as the next place to put my efforts.  These 
three functions are so full of hand coded parsing that rewriting them with
a Ragel processor would be a huge gain.

h2.  Feb-16: Mongrel 0.3.4 -- Win32 Pre-built Gems

This release has pre-built win32 gems thanks to Wilson Bilkovich attacking the
Rakefile and hooking up some build instructions for me.  You should now be able
to install on win32 without a build system just like with other projects.

I've also managed to clean up the CGIWrapper so that it works better with Mongrel
to Rails integration.  It should be much more stable and serve files correctly, and
it's been tested with eXPlain PMT as well as Typo.  The next release will involve
automated tests against as many Rails applications as I can find.

Finally, there is a fix for the command subsystem for a nil error when you didn't
give mongrel_rails a command.  It now lists the commands.

There is a small warning message I threw in that I want people to report if they
see.  You'll know it if you see it in the log/mongrel.log file or on the console.

h2.  Feb-14: Mongrel 0.3.3 Released

This is a very small release that does nothing but add a one line fix
for a major bug.  Basically, the 0.3.2 release works great with Rails,
but other runners will have problems since I didn't require the timeout
library needed.  Everyone should upgrade.

h2.  Feb-13: Mongrel 0.3.2 Released

Lots of little things people asked for in 0.3.1 release.  Changes are:

* FAQ questions answered on threading and deployment scenarios.
* Added some additional text to make the side icons a little clearer.
* Created a "dogs":/dogs.html page with some people's favorite pets.
* Write out a better message for *mongrel_rails start* giving the environment and other stuff.
* Default to using ENV['RAILS_ENV'] or "default" as environment.
* Removed the restriction on the environments so people can have custom ones.
* Added options for:
** _-n_ Number of processor threads.
** _-t_ Timeout for each processor before it kills a request.
** _-m_ Specify additional MIME type mappings in YAML format.
** _-c_ Change to directory before starting (both for start and stop commands)
** _-r_ Use a different document root from "public"
* Use "rb" as open mode on all platforms (for windows binary files)
* Fixed bug in DirHandler which prevented people from altering MIME mapping.

h2. Feb-12: Mongrel 0.3.1 Released

This release improves the support for Ruby On Rails, creates a new
Command/Plugin functionality, and fixes a huge nasty bug in how content
was served with Rails.  If you saw weird file serving such as broken
images and other bad downloads then this is the fix for you.
