h1. Using Mongrel Cluster<br>
<small><small>by Austin Godber</small></small>

"Mongrel_cluster":http://rubyforge.org/projects/railsmachine/ is a 
"GemPlugin":http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/gem_plugin_rdoc that wrappers 
the mongrel HTTP server and simplifies the deployment of webapps 
using a cluster of mongrel servers.  Mongrel_cluster will conveniently configure
and control several mongrel servers, or groups of mongrel servers, which are
then load balanced using a reverse proxy solution.  Typical load balancing
reverse proxies include:
* "Apache":apache.html - flexible and complex
* "Lighttpd":lighttpd.html - development has stalled
* "Pound":pound.html - Simple and SSL capable
* "Pen/Balance":pen_balance.html - Simple

h2. Requirements

Throughout these instructions we will assume the following:
* All mongrel instances are running on the same machine
* Mongrel prerelease *0.3.13* or greater
* Mongrel_cluster prerelease *0.1.3* or greater
* Linux platform (Centos 4.3 in this case, so you will see RedHat like commands).
* You have *sudo* or *root* access

h2. Preliminary steps

In general, when deploying a mongrel cluster, none of the mongrel servers will
be listening on a privileged port.  This is nice, we don't have to run mongrel as
root, therefore we should create a user for mongrel to run as:
<pre><code>
  $ sudo /usr/sbin/adduser -r mongrel
</code></pre>
For the purpose of this example we will just use a freshly minted rails app.
You can adjust these instructions to work with your app, wherever you may have
placed it but lets pretend we are working in */usr/local/vhosts*.  So lets go set
up our app and test that mongrel will serve it:
<pre><code>
  $ cd /usr/local/vhosts
  $ rails testapp
  $ cd testapp
  $ mongrel_rails start
</code></pre>
You should now be able to see your application at @http://host:3000/@.  If you
can, you are good to go.  Hit @CTRL+C@ to stop the mongrel server.  At a minimum
the log directory of your app has to be writable by the *mongrel* user:
<pre><code>
  $ sudo chown -R mongrel:mongrel /usr/local/vhosts/testapp
</code></pre>

h2. Mongrel Cluster Setup

With mongrel working and our webapp directory prepared we can proceed with the
mongrel_cluster configuration step:
<pre><code>
  $ sudo mongrel_rails cluster::configure -e production -p 8000 -N 3 \
    -c /usr/local/vhosts/testapp --user mongrel --group mongrel
</code></pre>
This will write a configuration file in *config/mongrel_cluster.yml*.  We have
setup to run our cluster in production mode as the user *mongrel* and will start
3 mongrel servers listening on ports 8000, 8001, and 8002.  Now, lets do a quick
test of what we have setup so far:
<pre><code>
   $ sudo mongrel_rails cluster::start
</code></pre>
Checking our host on ports 8000, 8001, and 8002 we should now be able to see our
test application.  We can stop all of those mongrels with 
@sudo mongrel_rails cluster::stop@.

h2. On Boot Initialization Setup

At this point, mongrel and mongrel_cluster are setup and working with our sample
webapp.  Ultimately, we want this cluster to start on boot.  Fortunately,
mongrel_cluster comes with an init script that we can just drop into place.  All
we need to do is put the configuration files in */etc/mongrel_cluster* and take care of
a few system tasks:
<pre><code>
  $ sudo mkdir /etc/mongrel_cluster
  $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/vhosts/testapp/config/mongrel_cluster.yml \
    /etc/mongrel_cluster/testapp.yml
  $ sudo cp \
    /path/to/mongrel_cluster_gem/resources/mongrel_cluster \
    /etc/init.d/
  $ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/mongrel_cluster 
</code></pre>
Now we have a typical System V init script that will launch our mongrel cluster.
Actually, this script will launch any cluster that has a configuration file in
*/etc/mongrel_cluster/*.  So when we run */etc/init.d/mongrel_cluster start* it
will start all clusters.  Likewise for stop and restart.  If we are using a
RedHat like system we can configure mongrel_cluster for startup:
<pre><code>
  $ sudo /sbin/chkconfig --level 345 mongrel_cluster on
</code></pre>

h2.  Conclusion

We have configured mongrel and mongrel_cluster with our webapp and setup
mongrel_cluster to run our cluster at startup.  What's missing?  Well, unless
your application users expect to have to connect to port 8000-8002 you had best
check out the reverse proxy options listed above.

The process of setting up mongrel_cluster will be the same for all of the
reverse proxy deployment options.  So this document will likely serve as a reference
for several of the other deployment guides.

<hr>

fn1.  Thanks to "Bradley Taylor":http://fluxura.com/ for writing 
mongrel_cluster and recent improvements in its startup capabilities.

fn2.  @adduser -r@ is a RedHat-centric way of creating a system account.  For
Debian-ish distributions replace that with @adduser --system mongrel@.
