h1.  Mongrel HOWTO

This is a collection of small tidbits of advice which don't fit into
larger documentation just yet.


h1. Alternative Deployment Scenarios

Since Mongrel uses plain HTTP there's a huge number of deployment 
scenarios you can use.  Take a look at the "Lighttpd instructions":lighttpd.html
for a more complete example.


h2. Pound+lighttpd+Mongrel

"Pound":http://www.apsis.ch/pound/ is a decent software only HTTP proxy that
also handles the SSL for you.  This means you can configure Pound with your
SSL certificates and it'll handle the virtual hosts and proxying.  The
interesting thing is that since Pound uses native threads it actually can't
keep up with lighttpd.


h2. Hardware Load Balancers

Another approach is to put a hardware load balancer in front of lighttpd 
and a bunch of Mongrel backends.  The attraction of this is that you
can just route requests directly to lighttpd without proxying through.


h3. URI Prefixes

One problem with many of these setups where you route requests for static
files to lighttpd, but dynamic requests to Mongrel is that the load balancer
needs a way of determining what is "dynamic" and what is "static".  Since
rails uses sane URIs it's difficult to figure this out without some kind
of prefix.

The easiest way I've found is to prefix your Rails routes.rb with "/app"
and then configure the load balancer to route anything starting with "/app"
to the Mongrel servers.
