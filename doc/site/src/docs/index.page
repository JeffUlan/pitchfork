h1. Available Documentation

We've got a small set of documentation to get people going.  Most of it is 
geared toward Ruby on Rails but other projects using Mongrel should have their own
docs that you can refer to based on these.


h2. Getting Started

Start here to get a good grounding in getting Mongrel up and running.
These documents are targeted at developers who will be starting off
using Mongrel and might want to throw in a few little tricks. 
Serious deployments should check out *Deployment Best Practices*.

* "Getting Started":started.html -- Installing and Other things
* "Win32 HOWTO":win32.html -- Specific instructions for running on windows.
* "HOWTO":howto.html -- Doing advanced stuff with Mongrel.
* "Using mongrel_cluster":mongrel_cluster.html -- Nifty plugin for managing your clusters.
* "Choosing A Deployment":choosing_deployment.html -- How to pick a best practice.
* "Security":security.html -- Security issues to look at (for any web application).


h2. Frameworks

Specific problems and things to know when you run different
frameworks.

* "Ruby on Rails Issues":ruby_on_rails.html
* "Camping Issues":camping.html
* "Nitro Issues":nitro.html


h2. Deployment Best Practices

These documents are continually changing as deploying Mongrel
becomes more solid and certain options and configurations
start to work the best.  Each one is a *best practice* which
means that if you do something different then you'll have to
do your own research.  Best way to work it is to do the 
*best practice* exactly as described, then try to do something
weird from there.

* "Apache":apache.html -- Currently the best way to deploy Mongrel.
* "Litespeed":litespeed.html -- Another good option, but not open source.
* "Lighttpd":lighttpd.html -- Using mod_proxy to do a cluster.
* "Pound":pound.html -- Small scale and dead simple with SSL.
* "Pen or Balance":pen_balance.html -- Smaller scale without SSL.


h2. Advanced

You are a grand master and have answered a few questions on the
Mongrel mailing list so now it's time to get fancy.

* "Writing Mongrel Plugins":gem_plugin.html -- Writing a GemPlugin for Mongrel.
* "From Rails To Handlers":rails_to_handler.html -- Writing a Handler plugin for something that's slow in Rails.
* "Distributed Worker":distributed_worker.html -- A common pattern for actions that take forever and block Rails.
* "Upload Progress Without Rails":upload_progress.html -- Uploading without blocking Rails and giving the user progress.
* "Performance Tuning":performance.html -- Measuring, tuning, tweaking (in that order).



h2. Ruby API Documentation

People writing plugins will want these.

* "Mongrel RDoc":/rdoc/index.html
* "GemPlugin RDoc":/gem_plugin_rdoc/index.html


If there's documentation you'd like then feel free to E-mail the list or post
to the tracker.

h1. Other People's Documentation

Many other folks have written documentation that they post to their
blogs for people to use.  I've based a lot of the documentation
here on their writings, so you should go check out their blogs
and shoot them a thanks when you can.

h1. Frequently Asked Questions

When people ask questions really frequently the results end up in the
"FAQ":../faq.html.


h1. Mailing Lists

There's a "mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/mongrel-users that
you should subscribe to if you're looking for help or are interested in tracking
Mongrel.  We post announcements of pre-release gems you can play with to this
mailing list and also discuss development of Mongrel there.

Before you start asking for features you should read about 
"bikeshedding":http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/bikeshedding.html and 
understand that we're really nice, but sometimes code speaks better than rhetoric.
