h1. Available Documentation

We've got a small set of documentation to get people going.  Most of it is 
geared toward Ruby on Rails but other projects using Mongrel should have their own
docs that you can refer to based on these.

* "Getting Started":started.html -- Installing and Other things
* "HOWTO":howto.html -- Doing advanced stuff with Mongrel.
* "Win32 HOWTO":win32.html -- Specific instructions for running on windows.
* "Lighttpd":lighttpd.html -- Using mod_proxy to do a cluster.

If there's documentation you'd like then feel free to e-mail the list or post
to the tracker.

h2. RDoc API Documentation

Check out the "RDoc":/rdoc/index.html documentation to get a look at the
API and dig into the source.  Since Mongrel is currently being used by
other frameworks it's documentation is aimed at developers.  Real manuals
will be written when there's something for "regular" folks to use.


h2. Frequently Asked Questions

When people ask questions really frequently the results end up in the
"FAQ":faq.html or if they're funny they end up in the "FASQ":fasq.html
so everyone can have a laugh.
