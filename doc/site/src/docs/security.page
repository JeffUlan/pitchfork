h1. Web Application Security Issues

Mongrel takes a different approach to security than most web servers.  Rather than
relying on massive human efforts to audit all possible code, Mongrel is implemented 
using algorithms and methods that are difficult to subvert.  There is still auditing
and checks, but Mongrel simply tries to avoid errors by not doing things that cause them.

Read the "Iron Mongrel Security page":/security.html for information on how security
is done in Mongrel.  The main points to remember with Mongrel's security are:

* Mongrel uses a "Ragel":http://www.cs.queensu.ca/home/thurston/ragel/ generated parser 
instead of a hand coded HTTP handler.  The grammar is very close to the ABNF specification, so
if you see "BAD CLIENT" errors in your logs, that probably is a bad client.
* Security tests have found that Mongrel stops most security attacks at the protocol level due to
it's correctly written parser *and* it's explicit limits on the sizes of everything.
* The Mongrel reaction to a protocol violation is to close the socket immediately.  It doesn't waste
time and resources on bad clients since this is *always* a hack attempt.  If it isn't then it's a
poorly written client and the author should learn to write a correct one.
* Mongrel works with all the main clients out there, and ones it doesn't work with are crap living
in a tiny tiny niche of the internet designed by horrible programmers.
* While Mongrel is more strict than other servers, it isn't draconian.  The clients that can't get 
through are typically skating on the edge of the HTTP grammar where they do not belong.

Mongrel isn't infallible, but if Mongrel complains about something then you should investigate it.
If you think Mongrel is wrong then shoot a message to the mailing list detailing what it should do
and we'll consider adjusting the grammar.  If you think Mongrel should violate the grammar so that
your little WebDAV++ Social Network Book Mark Chat Web 2.0 monstrosity can see the light of day, then
you "should write your own web server":/not_mongrel.html instead.
