This is an ultra simple Sinatra setup.

sinatra_example.rb

  This is a generic Sinatra application, absolutely nothing needs to be
  done to make this run with this application to run with Unicorn.


unicorn-sinatra-example

  this is the config file/application to execute with unicorn.  You can
  run it either standalone if "unicorn" is in your path, or by running:

  "unicorn unicorn-sinatra-example"


These examples do not load RubyGems.  You'll have to set your RUBYLIB
environment variable appropriately for running these examples, for me
it's this:

$HOME/gems/rack-0.9.1/lib:$HOME/gems/sinatra-0.9.0.2/lib:.
