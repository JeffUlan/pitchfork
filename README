= Unicorn:  UNIX-only fork of Mongrel

Experimental UNIX-only fork of Mongrel.  No threads.

Only run this behind nginx (or another fully-buffering reverse proxy,
I know of none) or to serve clients within the same datacenter.  This
is absolutely not designed to deal with slow clients.

See http://unicorn.bogomips.org for more information.

== License

Unicorn is copyright 2009 Eric Wong and contributors.
It is based on Mongrel:

Mongrel is copyright 2007 Zed A. Shaw and contributors. It is licensed
under the Ruby license and the GPL2. See the include LICENSE file for
details.

== Install

The library consists of a C extension so you'll need a C compiler or at
least a friend who can build it for you.

Finally, the source includes a setup.rb for those who hate RubyGems.

== Usage

== Contact

Newsgroup and mailing list coming, or it'll be a part of the Mongrel project.

Email Eric Wong at normalperson@yhbt.net for now.
