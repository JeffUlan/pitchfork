= Unicorn:  UNIX-only fork of Mongrel

Experimental UNIX-only fork of Mongrel.  No threads.

See http://unicorn.bogomips.org for more information.

== License

Unicorn is copyright 2009 Eric Wong and contributors.
It is based on Mongrel:

Mongrel is copyright 2007 Zed A. Shaw and contributors. It is licensed
under the Ruby license and the GPL2. See the include LICENSE file for
details.

== Quick Start

The easiest way to get started with Unicorn is to install it via
RubyGems and then run a Ruby on Rails application. You can do this
easily:

 $ gem install unicorn

== Install

The library consists of a C extension so you'll need a C compiler or at
least a friend who can build it for you.

Finally, the source includes a setup.rb for those who hate RubyGems.

== Usage

== Contact

Newsgroup and mailing list coming.
