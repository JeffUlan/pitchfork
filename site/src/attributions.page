h1. The People Who Made It Possible

There's quite a few people who either directly or indirectly helped to make Mongrel.  If we missed anyone then just e-mail us and we'll put your name here.

* Mongrel was started by "Zed A. Shaw":http://www.zedshaw.com/.
* Win32 support for services was done by Luis Lavena.
* Specialized Win32 gems were setup by Wilson Bilkovich.
* Why the lucky stiff implemented initial Camping support as well as improvements to Mongrel's file processing.
* Dan Kubb contributed conditional HTTP responses.
* MenTaL guY made Ruby threading not suck.
* Filipe Lautert handled various bugfixes.
* The JRuby team has been very supportive despite all the bugs we filed against them.
* Evan Weaver has been driving the 1.0.2 and 1.1 releases.

Also with lots of testing from tons of people who are really appreciated.

h1. Who To Contact

The easiest way to contact the Mongrel team is to mail the "Mongrel List":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/mongrel-users. If for some reason that's not appropriate, the best individuals to contact right now are probably "Filipe Lautert":https://rubyforge.org/users/filipe/, "Luis Lavena":http://blog.mmediasys.com/, or "Evan Weaver":http://blog.evanweaver.com.

h1. Commercial Sponsorship

Mongrel is a free open source web server and will always remain that way, but that doesn't mean that companies don't help to make it better.

Mongrel received sponsorship from "EastMedia Group":http://www.eastmedia.com in partnership with "VeriSign":http://www.verisign.com/ to make Mongrel fast and stable enough for their "PIP":http://pip.verisignlabs.com/ which should be a great Single Sign-On application and is being released open source.

Other companies benefiting from Ruby should take this as an example.  We can think of quite a few things that need some serious commercial cash to get them in gear.  If you're making cash off Ruby consider hiring a developer part-time, full-time, or posting a bounty for something you need as well as the community needs.  There's no better time for enlightened self-interest than now.
