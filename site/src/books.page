h1. Books About or Mentioning Mongrel

Pretty much every book about Rails mentions Mongrel these days. If you want yours to be listed here, pop a message to the "mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/mongrel-users. We are especially interested in books that aren't primarily about Rails.

h2. Mongrel: Serving, Deploying, and Extending Your Ruby Applications

This is of course the more or less official book, but don't take that to mean the others are bad.  It focuses entirely on Mongrel and is written by the Mongrel founder (Zed Shaw) and Matt Pelletier.

"You can buy it online as a PDF.":http://www.awprofessional.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0321483502&rl=1

h2. Repensando a web com Rails

This book was written by Fabio Akita with contributions from Zed and Piers Harding.  It is a book in Brazilian Portuguese and seems to cover quite a bit of material.  "You can read the blog for the site for more information.":http://www.balanceonrails.com.br/
