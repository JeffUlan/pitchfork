I asked people to send links to their favorite pictures of their dogs.  If you
want your dog listed here as another Mongrel Supporter then just shoot me an
e-mail: zedshaw AT zedshaw.com.

"My dog is lighting fast and 30 lbs small. Lean yet powerful.  (And he's a great guy too.)
His name is T-Bone and you can see pictures of him at, where else, 'the daily bone'."
