h1. Adoption of Mongrel

Many people have adopted Mongrel as their deployment or development server of choice, but we need some new success stories to post here. If you have a one, post it to the "mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/mongrel-users. Your project doesn't have to be public, just tell us how Mongrel made your life easier and what you like about it.

h2. Mac OS X

Mongrel and its dependencies are bundled with Mac OS X 10.5.

h2. OpenSUSE

"OpenSUSE":http://www.opensuse.org/ has a "page dedicated to Ruby":http://en.opensuse.org/Ruby
that also includes information on Ruby in their build service, how to install 
Ruby on Rails, and Mongrel rpms.  

Mongrel is also a part of the "SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SDK":http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/SLES_SDK
which I think was the first commercial distro.

It's maintained by Marcus R&uuml;ckert.

h2. CHOW.com

"CHOW.com":http://www.chow.com, a CNET Networks property, serves over 400,000 pageviews a day from a pack of 24 Mongrels. One of the Mongrel contributors, Evan Weaver, works there.

h2. Matt Pelletier ("EastMedia Group, Inc.":http://www.eastmedia.com/)

Matt uses Mongrel on nearly everything including the recent "VeriSign PIP Project":http://pip.verisignlabs.com/ project.

h2.  Josh Goebel

His "Pastie":http://pastie.caboo.se/ uses Mongrel and it's a slick little paste site with a nice IRC integrated bot.

h2. Benjamin Curtis

I saw your email to the list about Mongrel documentation, including  the Adoption page, and I thought I'd toss my info your way.  I'm  using Mongrel for both "tesly.com":http://www.tesly.com/ and "agilewebdevelopment.com":http://www.agilewebdevelopment.com/, both running on the same VPS being  proxied from lighty.  This has turned out to be a much more stable solution than lighty + fcgi.  My VPS is running Debian, so I've created init scripts to get those Mongrels going at boot time, and it works like a charm.

h2. "Jonathan Weiss":http://blog.innerewut.de

"MeinProf.de":http://meinprof.de/ was the first site to deploy Mongrel with Apache 2.2 and mod_proxy_balancer. We evaluated Mongrel as an alternative to FastCGI and were impressed by the ease of use and simplicity of the setup. Since then Mongrel drives up to 250.000 requests per day on MeinProf.de without any problems.

h1. Actually Adopting A Mongrel

If you're thinking of getting dog, consider adopting a real Mongrel
instead.

* Rescue a racing dog from "Greyhound Connection":http://www.greyhoundconnection.com/
* Adopt a homeless buddy from "The Humane Society":http://www.hsus.org/
* We judge people by how they treat beings weaker than themselves, and the "SPCA":http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer are good people.
