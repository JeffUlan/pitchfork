h1. What is Mongrel?

Mongrel is a fast HTTP library and server for Ruby that is intended for hosting
Ruby web applications of any kind using plain HTTP rather than FastCGI or SCGI.
It is framework agnostic and already supports "Ruby On
Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org, "Og+Nitro":http://www.nitroproject.org/, 
"Camping":http://camping.rubyforge.org/files/README.html, and
"IOWA":http://enigo.com/projects/iowa/tutorial/what_is_it.html frameworks.

h2. Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Mongrel is to install it via RubyGems
and then run a Ruby on Rails application.  You can do this easily:

 $ sudo gem install mongrel
 $ cd myrailsapp
 $ mongrel_rails start -d

Which runs Mongrel in the background.  You can stop it with:

 $ mongrel_rails stop

And you're all set.  There's quite a few options you can set for the
start command.  Use the *mongrel_rails start -h* to see them all.

h2. Win32 Support

Win32 is fully supported by Mongrel with services and CPU
affinity support.  You should read the "Win32 HOWTO":docs/win32.html
for information on getting started.

The main thing with Win32 support is that there is no *fork* 
API for Ruby, so you have to use the services features to
get persistent servers running.  You can get this services
support by doing:

  > gem install mongrel_service

And then just run @mongrel_rails@ to see what @services::@ commands
are available.


h1. Next Steps

Now that you're a Mongrel user, there's some thing you should
do to educate yourself:

* "Join the mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/mongrel-users 
* "Read the documentation":docs/index.html
* Learn to use --help when you want to know what Mongrel commands can do.

The last one is important.  A lot of effort went into making
Mongrel as self-documenting as possible.  Before you hit the
mailing list asking how to do something, try passing that
command --help and see if it tells you.  If it's still not 
clear then ask away.
