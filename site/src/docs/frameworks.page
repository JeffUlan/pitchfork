h1. Framework Issues

As known issues specific to different frameworks are reported they get
posted here.  Problems reported here aren't a sign that a framework is
worse or better than others, just a reflection of people's experiences.

h2. Rails

* Rails is not thread safe so if you have long running actions then you can potentially
block the server.  Keep in mind that this is the case for *any* server, it's just more
pronounced for Rails.
* You can easily kill a Rails server by not closing files.  Always open files in blocks.
* If you turn on @allow_concurrency@ them Mongrel will run your application without any thread locking.
This can be dangerous so test it first, and I'm pretty sure it won't work for most complex applications.
* Mongrel will honor a HUP request and try to do an internal reload, but this usually doesn't work the
way you think.  Mongrel's shutdown process is very nice and safe, so just restart.


h2. Camping

* Running Camping and Rails in the same Ruby interpreter 
causes all sorts of problems with ActiveRecord. You either run one or the
other but not both.


h2. Nitro

* None reported yet.
