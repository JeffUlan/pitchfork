* WONTFIX: code reloading and restarts with Sinatra 0.3.x (and likely older
  versions) apps is broken.  The workaround is to force production
  mode to disable code reloading as well as disabling "run" in your
  Sinatra application:
    set :env, :production
    set :run, false
  Since this is no longer an issue with Sinatra 0.9.x apps, this will not be
  fixed on our end.  Since Unicorn is itself the application launcher, the
  at_exit handler used in old Sinatra always caused Mongrel to be launched
  whenever a Unicorn worker was about to exit.

  Also remember we're capable of replacing the running binary without dropping
  any connections regardless of framework :)
