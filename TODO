* Documentation improvements

* ensure test suite passes on non-GNU/Linux systems
  (likely that it already does)

* consider adding "working_directory" directive to Configurator
  since START_CTX is ugly...

* consider adding user switching support (ugh...)
  This makes more sense for Rainbows!, but some folks use it already...

* fix const-correctness in HTTP parser

* performance validation (esp. TeeInput)

* improve test suite (steal from Rainbows!, probably...)
