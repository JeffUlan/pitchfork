* "Trailers:" support with TE:chunked requests

* Support HTTP/1.1 keepalive if (and probably only if) pipelining.
  We can do this by testing readability of socket immediately after
  the response is written.

* integration tests with nginx including bad client handling

* manpages (why do so few Ruby executables come with proper manpages?)

* code cleanups (launchers)

* Pure Ruby HTTP parser

* Rubinius support
