* SVN *
    
    * Upgraded to ServiceFB 'trunk' (but pistoned it, just in case).
    
    * Fixed problems with ruby installations outside PATH or inside folders with spaces.
    
    * Activate FB pedantic warnings by default (is really useful).
    
* 0.3.1 *
    
    * Single Service (SingleMongrel) object type implemented.
    
    * Updated Rakefile to reflect the new building steps.
    
    * Removed SendSignal, too hackish for my taste, replaced with complete FB solution.
    
    * Added basic Process monitoring and re-spawning.
